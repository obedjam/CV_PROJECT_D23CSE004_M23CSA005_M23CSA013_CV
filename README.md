Analog Clock Reader
Used various CV and DL techniques to develop a model capable of accurately detecting the time displayed on an analog clock, regardless of its orientation or angle. The model should be robust enough to handle variations in lighting conditions, clock design, and background clutter. It should accurately identify the position of the clock hands and translate their positions into a digital time format.
